This metadata captures various relevant pieces of information: from which organism the sample was derived, when and where the data was collected, data acquisition settings, etc.</p> <p>Public data on GNPS was processed using spectral library searching, and the unique metabolite annotations were used as features. Thus, our data table consists of the unique metabolites in the columns and the file names in the rows, with <code>1</code> if the metabolite was detected in that file, and <code>0</code> otherwise. Because there are hundreds of thousands of unique metabolites that can be annotated using the GNPS spectral libraries, this data table cannot be visualized directly. Instead, PCA was used to project the data into two or three dimensions for visualization purposes.</p> <p>Go to the ReDU website and start the PCA exploration by clicking on \u201cExplore Multivariate Analysis of Public Data\u201d.

There is no definitive answer, each techniques has its own assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses.</p> <p>Here we\u2019ll explore the difference between PCA and t-SNE using the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a large database of handwritten digits that is often used as a simple benchmark dataset to evaluate image processing systems.</p> <p></p> <p>Open the Tensorflow Embedding Projector website. This website provides a browser interface to implementations of a few common embedding algorithms (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP). An embedding is a low-dimensional space into which you can translate high-dimensional vectors. MNIST images are 28x28 pixels, thus they can be represented as 784 dimensional vectors.
