    "# Lab 1: Getting Started with Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Labs for this short course\n",
    "Each session will be split between lectures and a hands-on lab session like this one. We aim for these lab sessions serve multiple purposes:\n",
    "- Provide a space to explore the concepts discussed in the lectures.\n",
    "- See and use tools that rely on the machine learning methods we discuss.\n",
    "- Give a friendly first glimpse into the programming needed to develop machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of our lab sessions (like this one) will use an environment called a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Other sessions will be a guided walk-through the operation of specific mass spectrometry tools that use specific machine learning methods under the hood. Jupyter notebooks provide a way to marry text and code—a concept call *literate programming*—providing a rich interactive document for us to explore with. While you could install Jupyter on your computer, we are using a service called [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) to run these Jupyter notebooks on a borrowed computer in the cloud; thus, there are no installation requirements for the labs aside from a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will focus on familiarizing us with the Jupyter notebook interface, a short introduction to programming in Python, and exploring the \"bias-variance\" tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1: Meet your group!\n",
    "Everyone should have been assigned a random group for our lab sessions. Find the other 3–4 folks in your group and introduce yourself! This is an excellent time to help each other and learn together. Over the next 5 minutes, go around and introduce yourself with the following info and anything else you want to share:\n",
    "1. Your name (don't hesitate to gently correct mispronunciations!)\n",
    "2. Your preferred pronouns (he/him, she/her, them/they, ...)\n",
    "3. Where you are from, as specific as you want to be.\n",
    "4. Why are you interested in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your group should be the first folks you look at to answer questions and discuss the excersises during the labs. However, if you do get stuck or have a remaining question, don't hesistate to ask for help! Use your post-it notes (we should have already talked about what the colors mean) to signal that your group needs help and one of the instructors will be over as soon as possible to assist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: Introducing Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "We chose to use Jupyter notebook environments with Binder, because they provide a way for us to explore the machine learning method we discuss with little-to-no setup required. However, the notebook interface can be intimidating, particularly if you've never programmed before. If this describes how you're feeling, please don't worry; We've tried to design these labs to be approachable by anyone—with or without coding experience—once they understand the Jupyter notebook interface at a high-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Jupyter Lab interface\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks allow us to switch between writing text (in a syntax called \"markdown\") and code using the concept of cells. The markdown cells are where we've written the prose for excersises. In fact, the text you're reading right now is contained in a markdown cell. Here are the different parts of a Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "![notebook](images/blank-notebook-ui.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running code in Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "Code cells contain code that we can run. When we run or execute a code cell, the computer reads the code that is written in it and uses it as a set of instructions to do *something*—whatever, we've programmed it to do. Many of the exercises involve running code that we've already written and modifying it in specific ways to see what happens. Throughout the labs, you'll see two types of code: Python and shell commands (commands you would run from the command line or terminal).\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell is indicated with a `[x]:` beside it, where `x` is blank if the code cell has never been run. After a code cell has been run `x` indicates the order in which that code cell was run, among all of the other code cells in the notebook. Some code cells will also output text or images when they are run. These outputs appear below the code cell that generated them and are updated each time the code cell is run. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run the example code cell below, click on the cell and press the \"Run\" button in the toolbar, or pressing ⌘Cmd + Enter (MacOS) or Ctrl + Enter (Windows). \n",

We have no expectation that you've programmed in any language before, but as you saw in the previous exerciese, we will often be working together on small modifications to Python code in these labs. We chose this format, so that everyone would be exposed to Python code and that these labs could serve as a jumping-off point to pursue your interests after the course. However, we'll need to introduce a little bit of how Python works to maximize your experience.\n",
