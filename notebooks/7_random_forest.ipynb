    "The [Proteomics Data Mining Challenge 2020](https://proteomicsnews.blogspot.com/2020/02/proteomics-data-mining-challenge-2020.html) was a community challenge to (re)analyze public amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) proteomics to find putative biomarkers. ALS is a progressive nervous system disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing loss of muscle control, eventually leading to death.\n",
